This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error. The program defines a function that takes a coordinate object as an argument and prints the x and y values of the coordinate. However, the program attempts to assign a string value to a number variable, which results in a type error. The solution shows how to correct this error by assigning a number value to the variable.
